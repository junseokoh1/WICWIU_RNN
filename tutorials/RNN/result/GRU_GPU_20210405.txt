goodly proceed them proceed by thy face to see
i have sat too long

volumnia
nay go not from us thus
if it were so that our request did tend
to save the romans thereby to destroy
the volsces whom you serve you were foreadvised had touchd his spirit
and tried his inclination; from him pluckd
either his gracious promise which you might
as cause had calld you up have held him to
or else it would have galld his surly nature
which easily endures not article
tying him to aught; so putting him to rage
you should have taen the advantage of his choler
and passd him unelected

brutus
did you perceive
he did solicit you in free contempt
when he did need your loves and do you think
that his contempt shall not be bruising to you
when he hath power to crush why had your bodies
no heart among you or had you tongues to cry
against the rectorship of judgment

sicinius
have you
ere now denied the asker and now again
of him that did not ask but mock bestow
your suedfor tongues

third citizen
hes not confirmd; we may deny him yet

second citizen
and will deny him
ill have five hundred voices of that sound

first citizen
i twice five hundred and hear cominius speak

brutus
most willingly;
but yet my caution was more pertinent
than the rebuke you give it

menenius
he loves your people
but tie him not to be their bedfellow
worthy cominius speak
nay keep your place

first senator
sit coriolanus; never shame to hear
what you have nobly done

coriolanus
your horrors pardon
i had rather have my wounds to heal again
than hear say how i got them

brutus
sir i hope
my words disbenchd you not

coriolanus
no sir yet oft
when blows have ever thou art no better report than a horsedrench is he
not wounded he was wont to come home wounded

virgilia
o no no no

sicinius
i do demand
if you submit you to the peoples voices
allow their officers and are content
to suffer lawful censure for such faults
as shall be proved upon you

coriolanus
i am content

menenius
lo citizens he says he is content
the warlike service he has done consider; think
upon the wounds his body bears which show
like graves i the holy churchyard

coriolanus
scratches with briers
scars to move laughter only

menenius
consider further
that when he speaks not like a citizen
you find him like a soldier do not take
his rougher accents for malicious sounds
but as i say such as become a soldier
rather than envy you

cominius
well well no more

coriolanus
what is the matter
that being passd for consul with full voice
i am so dishonourd that the very hour
you take it off again

sicinius
answer to us

coriolanus
say then tis true i ought so

sicinius
we charge you that you have contrived to take
from rome all seasond office and to wind
yourself into a power tyrannical;
for which you are a traitor to the people

coriolanus
how traitor

menenius
nay temperately; your promise

coriolanus
the fires i the lowest hell foldin the people
call me their traitor thou injurious tribune
within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths
in thy hand clutchd as many millions in
thy lying tongue both numbers i would say
thou liest unto thee with a voice as free
as i do pray the gods

sicinius
mark you this people

citizens
to the rock to the rock with him

sicinius
peace
we need not put new matter to his charge
what you have seen him do and heard him speak
beating your officers cursing yourselves
opposing laws with strokes and here defying
those whose great power must try him; even this
so criminal and in such capital kind
deserves the extremest death

brutus

served well for rome

proceed them up down with about that our power to rome gates this had no further with them against the and to their loves
cog their hearts from them and come home beloved
of all the trades in rome look i am going
commend me to my wife ill return consul;
or never trust to what my tongue can do
i the way of flattery further

volumnia
do your will

cominius
away the tribunes do attend you arm yourself
to answer mildly; for they are prepared
with accusations as i hear more strong
than are upon you yet

coriolanus
the word is mildly pray you let us go
let us such as they would dot; for look you sir he has as
many friends as enemies; which friends sir as it
were durst not look you sir show themselves as
we term it his friends whilst hes in directitude

first servingman
directitude whats that

third servingman
but when they shall see sir his crest up again
and the man in blood they will out of their
burrows like conies after rain and revel all with
him

first servingman
but when goes this forward

third servingman
tomorrow; today; presently; you shall have the
drum struck up this afternoon tis as it were a
parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they
wipe their lips

second servingman
why then we shall have a stirring world again
this peace is nothing but to rust iron increase
tailors and breed balladmakers

first servingman
let me have war say i; it exceeds peace as far as
day does night; its spritely waking audible and
full of vent peace is a very apoplexy lethargy;
mulled deaf sleepy insensible; a getter of more
bastard children than wars a destroyer of men

second servingman
tis so and as war in some sort may be said to
be a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a
great maker of cuckolds

first servingman
ay and it makes men hate one another

third servingman
reason; because they then less need one another
the wars for my money
