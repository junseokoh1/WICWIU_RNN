red as twould burn rome; and his injury
the gaoler to his pity i kneeld before him;
twas very faintly he said rise; dismissd me
thus with his speechless hand what he would do
he sent in writing after me; what he would not
bound with an oath to yield to his conditions
so that all hope is vain
unless his person is i cannot ere let the suit of rome gates and go ill hear but one thing up will he tumble down

i am content

upon the wounds his body bears which show
like graves i the holy churchyard

coriolanus

scars to move laughter only

menenius
consider further
that when he speaks not to this instant banish him our city
in peril of precipitation
from off the rock tarpeian never more
to enter our rome to his senate and are so we have shamed me
in your condemned seconds

if i should tell thee oer this thy days work

we are accounted poor citizens the patricians good
what authority surfeits on would relieve us if they

wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely;
but they think we are too dear the leanness that
afflicts us the object of our misery is as an
inventory to particularise their abundance; our
sufferance is a gain to them let us revenge this with
our pikes ere we become rakes for the gods know i
speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge

would you proceed especially against caius marcius

all
against him first hes a very dog to the commonalty

second citizen
consider you what services he has done for his country

first citizen
very well; and could be content to give him good

nay but speak not maliciously

first citizen
i say unto you what he hath done famously he did
it to that end though softconscienced men can be
content to say it was for his country he did it to
please his mother and to be partly proud; which he
is even till the altitude of his virtue
